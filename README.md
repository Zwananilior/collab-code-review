## Setup Instructions

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/collab-code-review-platform.git
cd collab-code-review-platform
Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
Create .env file in the root folder (see below).
Setup PostgreSQL database (see Database Setup below).
Run the development server
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Server will listen on http://localhost:4000.
WebSocket server listens on port 4050.

Database Setup
Create a new database in PostgreSQL, e.g., collab_review.

Open pgAdmin and run the provided schema.sql file to create tables:

users

projects

submissions

comments

reviews

Optionally, insert seed data for testing.

Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory:

ini
Copy code
PORT=4000
WS_PORT=4050
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YourPassword@localhost:5432/collab_review
Replace YourPassword with your PostgreSQL password.

Running the Project
Start server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Open Postman to test endpoints.

Ensure your JWT token is included in requests requiring authorization.
